# Prework Study Guide 

## Description

This Study Guide was created to help new boot camp students get familiarized with the future concepts we will learn. As well an introduction in action to what is expected and how to read, write, and understand said concepts. Through out this project I was able to learn the very basic fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Git. Now that the project is concluded I feel prepared to start the course.
